# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-CNN-and-IWD-MATLAB-
This project implements a brain tumor detection system using a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with Intelligent Water Drops (IWD) optimization. It is developed in MATLAB and includes a GUI for visualization and interaction.
# Brain Tumor Detection using CNN + IWD

This MATLAB project uses a CNN model and Intelligent Water Drops (IWD) optimization technique to detect and segment brain tumors from MRI images.

## Features
- Custom CNN implementation
- Intelligent Water Drops for optimization
- GUI in MATLAB (`brain_tumor_gui.m`)
- Sample MRI dataset included

## How to Run
1. Open MATLAB
2. Run `brain_tumor_gui.m` or `cnn_tumor_train.m` to start training
3. Use `cnn_tumor_test.m` or GUI for predictions
